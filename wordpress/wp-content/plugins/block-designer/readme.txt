Martin Sauter:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ***The best visual custom block creator so far***
*If you have tried Lazy Blocks or Genesis Custom Blocks and are looking for a more visual way to both create and use custom blocks, this plugin is for you: Creating a custom block is very much like building a post in the Gutenberg block editor (no coding required), and using your custom block is completely WYSIWYG (no form).*

= How it works =

1. **Design your block**

   First you design your block in the *Block Designer* with different HTML elements and styles.
   
   You can define areas where authors can insert images and text in the *WordPress Block Editor*.

   After you designed your block, you only need to enable and save it.

2. **Use your block**

   If you enabled and saved your block, you will find your block in the Inserter panel of the *WordPress Block Editor*.

   Just insert it as you know it from ordinary blocks.

   If you have defined areas for author input, you can add your content now.

   Save your page/post and enjoy your result on your site ;)


== Screenshots ==

1. This is the overview of all your created blocks.
2. This is the view when you design one of your blocks.
3. In the WordPress Block Editor, you can always preview your block by hovering over your block icon.
4. Use your block as often as you want.
